Algorithm to shape classification using Topological Data Analysis tools. //
Open source dataset: https://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html //
You can find the objects sampled with FPS in the same fold. //
The algorithm is implemented without camel shapes, but we include them sampled with FPS in the fold.
